# üìä Sentiment Analysis Using RNN & GRU AI Project
This project performs sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, Neutral) on text data using Recurrent Neural Networks, specifically comparing SimpleRNN and GRU-based architectures.

‚úÖ Final deployed model: GRU, due to better generalization and validation stability.
‚ùå LSTM & Bidirectional layers were tested but excluded due to overfitting or poor generalization.
## Project Overview

- **Model**: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) / Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- **Datasets**: Provided training and testing datasets
- **Goal**: To build a model that can predict the sentiment of a given text

## File Structure

- `Sentiment Analysis using RNN & GRU.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- `train.csv`: Training dataset.
- `test.csv`: Testing dataset.

## Dataset
Source: Pre-split CSVs (train.csv, test.csv)
Size:
Train: 27,481 samples
Test: Remaining from dataset
Labels:
-positive ‚Üí 0
-negative ‚Üí 1
-neutral ‚Üí 2
## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- tensorflow
- sklearn
- matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy tensorflow sklearn matplotlib
```
## Detailed Steps
1. Data Preprocessing
Load the training and testing datasets.
Perform text preprocessing such as tokenization and padding.
Encode the sentiment labels into numerical values.
3. Model Building
Define the RNN model.
Compile the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer.
Train the model on the training data.
4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.
Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Predictions
Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new text samples.
Display the predicted sentiment for the given text.
Steps to Analyze the Datasets and Create Descriptions
## Steps to Analyze the Datasets 
1. Load the Datasets:
Use pandas to load your CSV files.
```bash
import pandas as pd
train_df = pd.read_csv('train.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-1')
test_df = pd.read_csv('test.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-1')
```
2. Preprocess the Data:
Handle missing values, if any.
Tokenize text data and prepare it for the RNN model.
```bash
from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=20000)
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(train_df['text'])

X_train = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(train_df['text'])
X_test = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(test_df['text'])

X_train = pad_sequences(X_train, padding='post', maxlen=35)
X_test = pad_sequences(X_test, padding='post', maxlen=35)

```
3.Build and Train the RNN Model:

Create and compile your RNN model
```bash
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(input_dim=20000, output_dim=5, input_length=35))
model.add(SimpleRNN(32,return_sequences=False))
model.add(Dense(3,activation='softmax'))
model.compile(optimizer='adam',loss='categorical_crossentropy',metrics=["accuracy"])
```
Train the model.
```bash
history = model.fit(X_train , y_train , epochs=10,validation_data=(X_test,y_test))
```
test/make predictions
```bash
text = input("Enter any Sentence :")
sequence = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([text])
padding = pad_sequences(sequence , padding='post',maxlen=35)
pred = model.predict(padding)
pred_class = pred.argmax(axis=-1)
if pred_class[0] == 0:
    print("Positive Sentiment");
elif pred_class[0] == 1:
    print("Negative Sentiment")
else :
    print("Natural Sentiment")
```
## Example Predictions
#The notebook includes examples of predicting the sentiment of new text samples. Here are a few examples:

Input: "I absolutely loved the movie I watched last night. It was so heartwarming and inspiring!"

Predicted Sentiment: Positive
Input: "I hate the traffic in this city. It's so frustrating."

Predicted Sentiment: Negative
Input: "The weather today is nice."

Predicted Sentiment: Neutral
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sentiment analysis on text data. The model is capable of predicting the sentiment of new text samples with reasonable accuracy.

Feel free to explore the notebook and experiment with the model on your own text data. If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
